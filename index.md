## Hello!
### Welcome to my homepage.


I am expecting to graduate with a BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram. For my master's thesis, I worked on a project in cosmology. I am interested in studying neutron stars, the cosmic microwave background and star forming activities outside our galaxy.

*I am an incoming graduate student at the West Virginia University.
