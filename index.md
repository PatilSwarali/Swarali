## Hello!
### Welcome to my homepage.

I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the West Virginia University, USA. I  am a graduate teaching assitant.
I graduated with a BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram. For my master's thesis, I worked on a project in cosmology. I am interested in studying neutron stars, the cosmic microwave background and star forming activities outside our galaxy.
